## 🧭 Step 1: Understand What MAANG Really Hires For

MAANG doesn’t hire _“React devs”_ or _“Spring Boot devs”_.  
They hire **Software Engineers** — generalists who can **learn and adapt fast**.

That means:

> You don’t need to be backend/frontend/mobile only — but you need **strong core CS fundamentals** + **project depth** in at least one area.

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Core Skill Areas MAANG Evaluates

|Area|Why It Matters|How to Prepare|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**|60–70% of interviews focus here|LeetCode, NeetCode, InterviewBit|
|**System Design**|Needed for SDE-2+ roles (scalability, architecture)|Study Grokking System Design, YouTube resources|
|**Coding Language Mastery**|Clean, efficient code in one language|Pick **Java, Python, C++**, or **TypeScript**|
|**Computer Science Fundamentals**|OS, DBMS, Networking, OOP, etc.|Use CS50, Neso Academy, or GFG resources|
|**Project Experience**|Demonstrates real-world application|Build 2–3 solid projects that solve real problems|
|**Communication & Problem Solving**|Crucial for team interviews|Practice explaining your thought process out loud|

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Pick a Tech Domain (your “specialization”)

MAANG has **different entry paths**, depending on your interests.  
You don’t have to stick to backend — choose what excites you 👇

|Domain|Key Skills|Frameworks / Tools|Example MAANG Teams|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Frontend (Web)**|React, TypeScript, performance optimization|React, Next.js, Angular|Meta UI teams, Google Search UI|
|**Backend / Full Stack**|API design, databases, scalability|Spring Boot, Node.js, Django|Amazon APIs, Netflix services|
|**Mobile (Android / iOS)**|App architecture, UX, optimization|Kotlin, Swift, Jetpack Compose|Instagram, Apple apps|
|**Machine Learning / AI**|Data pipelines, modeling, ML deployment|Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch|Google AI, Meta Research|
|**Data Engineering**|Big data systems, pipelines|Spark, Hadoop, SQL, Airflow|Netflix Analytics, Amazon Data Infra|
|**DevOps / Cloud**|CI/CD, containers, infrastructure|Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform|AWS Infra, Google Cloud Teams|
|**Security / SRE**|Monitoring, automation, reliability|Python, Go, Prometheus, Grafana|Meta Infra, Google SRE|

✅ You don’t have to master all — **pick one** to go deep into while staying grounded in DSA and CS concepts.

## 🧠 Step 4: Learn the MAANG Hiring Process

Most roles follow **this pattern**:

|Stage|What They Test|Example Questions|
|---|---|---|
|**1️⃣ Online Assessment (OA)**|DSA problems|Arrays, Strings, Graphs, DP|
|**2️⃣ Technical Interviews (2–3 rounds)**|Algorithms + problem-solving|“Find Kth largest element”, “Reverse a linked list”|
|**3️⃣ System Design (for SDE-2+)**|Architecture, scalability|“Design Instagram Feed”|
|**4️⃣ Behavioral Interview**|Culture fit, ownership, leadership|“Tell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate”|

So even if you’re a frontend engineer, **DSA + problem-solving** still matter a lot.

## 🪜 Step 5: 12-Month Roadmap (Practical Plan)

### 🩵 **Month 1–3: Build Strong Foundations**

- Pick one primary language (Java, Python, or C++)
- Start DSA → Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees
- Learn basics of OS, DBMS, and OOP
- Start 1 small project (e.g., notes app, portfolio site)

### 🩷 **Month 4–6: Choose a Domain**

- If frontend: learn React + APIs
- If backend: learn Node.js or Spring Boot
- If ML: learn Python + pandas + ML basics
- Build a **portfolio project** (host it on GitHub & deploy)

### 🩶 **Month 7–9: Advanced Problem Solving + System Design**

- Medium/Hard LeetCode problems
- Learn about caching, databases, APIs, scalability
- Build a **large project** (e.g., mini Instagram / task tracker)

### ❤️ **Month 10–12: Interview Prep + Resume**

- Mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io)
- Prepare 10+ DSA patterns (Sliding Window, Recursion, DP, Graphs)
- Write a **solid resume** highlighting projects and impact
- Apply + network on LinkedIn + referrals

---

## 💼 Step 6: Resume Strategy for MAANG

✅ Highlight **impact**, not just tech stack:

> ❌ Built a notes app in React.  
> ✅ Built a note app with autosave and real-time sync using React & Firebase, reducing data loss by 50%.

✅ Include **GitHub + LinkedIn + Portfolio site**  
✅ Use **keywords** (Java, APIs, scalable systems, microservices, etc.)

---

## ⚡ Step 7: Recommended Stack to Learn (Balanced Choice)

If you’re not sure which side to pick yet, this combo gives you **MAANG-ready exposure**:

|Layer|Tech to Learn|
|---|---|
|**Frontend**|React + TypeScript|
|**Backend**|Node.js (Express or NestJS) or Spring Boot|
|**Database**|PostgreSQL + Redis|
|**DevOps (Basic)**|Docker + AWS EC2|
|**Problem Solving**|DSA (LeetCode, 2–3 problems/day)|

That combo alone makes you **interview-ready** for 90% of MAANG-like roles.

---

## 🧠 Final Thought

To get into MAANG:

> 🚀 You don’t need 10 frameworks — you need **one deep skill area**, **strong DSA**, and **good communication**.

So:

- Master **DSA + one language**
- Pick **one specialization** (frontend, backend, ML, etc.)
- Build **2–3 real projects**
- Practice **interviews like a sport**
