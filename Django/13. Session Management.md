HTTP is a stateless protocol, there is no socket connection alive the socket is destroyed every time the new response arrive, user need to make new connection every time. For every request is a fresh connection. stateless it doesn't remember anything from previous request or response.

### Session Tracking

To maintain the state despite the statelessness of HTTP

What is Session?
- Login to Logout (facebook, gmail)
- Track user interaction (ecommerce, ticket booking)

#### Django Session Management

session tracking - cookie
session API - django server will create session and give a unique session id (dictionary) its the browsers responsibility to send the ==**cookie**== back, if cookie is disabled in in the client side the django will fall back to ==**URL Rewriting**== in forms it uses ==**hidden fields**==.

##### Cookie Support

request.session
- set_test_cookie()
- test_cookie_worked()
- delete_test_cookie()

Example:
```
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    request.session.set_test_cookie()
    return HttpResponse("Set test cookie")

def page2(request):
    if request.session.test_cookie_worked():
        request.session.delete_test_cookie()
        return HttpResponse("Test cookie worked")
    else:
        return HttpResponse("Test cookie did not work")
```

```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from cookiesApp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home/',views.home, name='home'),
    path('page2/',views.page2, name='page2')
]
```

#### Page Hit Count using Cookies

```
def countView(request):
    count = request.COOKIES.get('count', 0)
    count = int(count) + 1
    response = HttpResponse("You have visited this page {} times".format(count))
    response.set_cookie('count', count)
    return response
```

```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home/',views.home, name='home'),
    path('page2/',views.page2, name='page2'),
    path('countView/',views.countView, name='countView')
]
```

output: 
The count will increase for every reload
